### *Summary*
Civil War Washington both archives and interprets data, texts and visual works from Washington D.C. during the civil war. The project seeks to display the rapid transition which occurred in Washington once the civil war broke out. It reveals the perspectives of individuals from all walks of life and their experience within the city.

### *Design*
The project is equipped with the proper coding to allow ease of use on laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. The project's homepage features an easy to navigate display of all the tabs available to users. Once a tab is selected, the user is instructed upon the purpose of the tab at the top of each webpage. In addition, while using the site, a toolbar is accessible at the top of each webpage ensuring other tabs to be effortlessly accessible.

### *Findings*
Civil War Washington masterfully exposes users to an exponential amount of data and resources in tabs which are easy to navigate. The **Introduction tab** is creatively designed to set the scene for the time period through extensive narrative texts. The information provided here lays the necessary groundwork needed in understanding the resources provided within the other tabs.

The **Maps tab** contains information regarding both the mapsâ€™ purpose and how to interact with the map itself. This addition is incredibly helpful considering the complexity of the map and its many features. The map itself is very visually appealing and puts into perspective the landscape of wartime Washington. The map does however contain two flaws. The interactive keys on the right of the map overlap rendering them partially useless. Additionally, several points on the map lack links to additional information even when links are available. For example, the bawdy houses contain the names of the homeowners, but it lacks links to the information presented in the data tab.

The **Data** and **Texts tabs** both contain search bars allowing users to easily locate specific information. The data tab in particular contains a flaw where four out of five links do not actually lead to the data download it offers. Aside from this, both the tabs have an added feature allowing users to freely browse various categories (people, places, newspapers, medical cases, etc.). 

The **Visual Works tab** provides authentic pictures taken in Washington during the civil war. These photos allow users to immerse themselves into Washington during this chaotic period. 
 
The **Interpretations tab** contains several essays written by the authors of Civil War Washington. These essays allow readers the opportunity to better understand the values and biases that may have influenced the project. Furthermore, many of the essays dive deep into the issues unfolding in Washington and provide remarkable coverage of the topics. 

The project overall is a remarkable resource which shines a light on the environment in Washington during the civil war. It allows for in depth research into individuals, as well as providing a comprehensive overview of large subject matters. The project is very user friendly with every section and tab containing instructions on functionality.
