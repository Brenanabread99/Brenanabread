Civil War Washington both *archives* and *interprets* **data, texts, maps, and visual works** from Washington D.C. during the Civil War. The project seeks to display the rapid transition which occurred in Washington once the Civil War broke out. It reveals the perspectives of individuals from all walks of life and their experiences within the city.

### *Design*

The project equips the proper coding to allow ease of use on laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. The project's homepage features an easy-to-navigate display of all the tabs available to users. Once a tab is selected, readers are instructed upon the purpose of the tab at the top of each webpage. This feature greatly helps readers by preventing them from scanning the full webpage in search of its purpose. In addition, while using the site, a toolbar is accessible at the top of each webpage providing access to other tabs. This design allows readers to explore the site without the difficulty of getting lost along the way. 

### *Findings*

Civil War Washington exposes readers to an exponential amount of data and resources in organized tabs that are easy to navigate. The **Introduction tab** design sets the scene for wartime Washington through extensive narrative texts and ellaborates on the countless resources used for the project. The information provided here lays the necessary groundwork needed in understanding the resources provided within the other tabs.

The **Maps tab** contains information regarding both the maps’ purpose and how to interact with the map itself. An addition which is incredibly helpful considering the complexity of the map and its many features. The map itself is very visually appealing and puts into perspective the landscape of wartime Washington.

The map does however contains a couple flaws. The interactive map key overlaps itself rendering it partially useless. Additionally, numerous points on the map do not have links to information even when it is available. For example, the bawdy houses contain the names of the homeowners. However, it does not provide links to the additional information available in the data tab. Lastly, two of the maps provided are not large enough to display all the points provided. The outmost points are then displayed in a white void thus defeating the purpose of the map.

The **Data** and **Texts tabs** both contain search bars allowing users to easily locate specific information. The data tab in particular contains a flaw where four out of five links do not actually lead to the data downloads they offer. Aside from this though, both tabs have an added feature allowing users to freely browse various categories (people, places, newspapers, medical cases, etc.). 

The **Visual Works tab** provides authentic pictures taken in Washington during the Civil War. These photos allow users to immerse themselves in Washington during this chaotic period.

The **Interpretations tab** contains several essays written by the authors of Civil War Washington. These essays educate readers on the values and biases that may have influenced the project. Furthermore, many of the essays dive deep into the issues unfolding in Washington. The essays cover topics such as medical cases, emancipations, hospitals, and segregation just to name a few. The analysis itself comes from every conceivable perspective thus providing a clear picture of each topic.

The project overall is a remarkable resource that shines a light on the environment in Washington during the Civil War. It allows for in depth research into individuals, as well as providing a comprehensive overview of large subject matters.
