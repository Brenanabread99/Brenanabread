I had a difficult time developing an idea for the map project. As both a commuter and a transfer student, I have very few good stories worth telling about my time here at CNU. During a brainstorming session in class, I thought maybe I could create a fictional story. While I thought this idea was gold, neither my professor nor the others at my table were thrilled with the idea. 

I also considered telling the story of how I transferred into the university. I began brainstorming the idea, but quickly realized there is not much of a story to tell. While the transfer into CNU was a rough transition, most of my experiences were isolated events which do not form a coherent story.

After these two failures, I began to consider what things I have done at CNU that forms a 10-part story. I quickly realized the only story I could tell to meet these criteria would be to detail a typical day at school.

So, I began taking pictures and videos throughout my day to document what life is like for me. I took pictures of my lectures and videos of anything even remotely eventful that occurred during my routine. 

As I gathered pictures from throughout my day, I began to see my typical day form into a coherent story. A story which just barely met the criteria for ten parts. Once I finished collecting my different types of media for the day, I attempted to transfer my media into Thinglink. 

Transferring my videos to my computer and then into Thinglink was more difficult than I expected. After multiple unsuccessful attempts, I simply uploaded the videos directly into Thinglink from my phone. After realizing the simplicity of the user interface, I continued designing my interactive map from my phone. 

As I created different icons on the map, I numbered them one through ten to display the progression of my day. It crossed my mind that I could create my own icons displaying what time each part of my day started. However, after attempting for a significant amount of time to create my own icons, I abandoned the idea returned to the simpler option. 

Ultimately, my project displays ten different events which always occur during my Monday, Wednesday, and Friday routine. I attempted to include at least one picture or video in all my interactive points to help visualize my day. 

When I was first introduced to this project, it genuinely scared me. I had no idea where I would take this project since I spend so little time on campus as a commuter student. However, after completing the project, I realize that my college life is not as bland as I previously thought. Granted it may not be as exciting as some who live on campus, but I do get to interact and have fun with the few friends I’ve managed to make along the way. In the end, those moments I get to share with others is all that really matters.
