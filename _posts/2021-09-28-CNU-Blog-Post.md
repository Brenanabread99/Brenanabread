**Developing the Topic**

I had a difficult time developing an idea for the map project. As both a commuter and a transfer student, I have very few good stories worth telling about my time here at CNU. During a brainstorming session in class, the thought of possibly creating a fictional story arose. While this idea seemeed like a perfect solution, neither my professor nor the others at my table were thrilled with the idea. 

The story of my transfer into the university also came to mind. I began brainstorming the idea, but quickly realized there is not much of a story to tell. While the transfer into CNU was a rough transition, most of my experiences were isolated events which did not form a coherent story.

After these two failures, I began to consider which of my experiences at CNU would forms a 10-part story. I quickly realized the only story available to meet these criteria would be to detail a typical day at school.

**Colecting Media**

So, I began collecting different forms of media throughout the day to document what an average day is like. Pictures were taken during of my lectures and videos of anything even remotely eventful that occurred during my routine. 

As this media was collected from throughout my day, My routine began to form into a coherent story. A story which just barely met the criteria for ten parts. Once the data collection was finished, I attempted to transfer my media into Thinglink. 

**Creating the Map**

Transferring the videos to my computer and then into Thinglink was more difficult than was expected. After multiple unsuccessful attempts, An easier method was employed by simply uploading the videos directly into Thinglink from my phone. After realizing the simplicity of the user interface, I continued designing my interactive map from my phone. 

During the creation of the different icons on the map, They were numbered one through ten to display the progression of the day. I attempted to create personalized icons which would display what time each part of the day started. However, after attempting this for a significant amount of time, the idea was abandoned and simpler option was used. 

With the project now completed, it displays ten different events which always occur during my Monday, Wednesday, and Friday routine. At least one picture or video ais contained in all the interactive points to help visualize my typical day.

**Reflection**

When I was first introduced to the idea that I would have to map my experiences at CNU, it genuinely scared me. With my limited experience on campus as a commutter student, I had no idea what direction my map should take. However, after completing the project, I realize that my college life is not as bland as I previously thought. Granted it may not be as exciting as some who live on campus, but I do get to interact and have fun with the few friends Iâ€™ve managed to make along the way. In the end, those moments I get to share with others is all that really matters.
