# Brennen Savi's About Me

![Brennen Savi](https://brenanabread99.github.io/Brenanabread/images/ProfileImage3.jpg)

I am currently working towards attaining my BA in Psychology at _Christopher Newport University_. After I graduate, I plan to seek a master’s in counseling at _Liberty University_ from which I will pursue my passion of helping others through becoming a Licensed Professional Counselor. I currently have a mentor who is guiding me through school and is instructing me on how to be a Christian and a counselor in a secular enviroment.

My faith is something I center and build my life around. I am very involved with two churches in my area, and I’ve been a 1st grade leader at one for the last three and a half years. At college I've recently begun attending a fellowship group and joined a weekly bible study. In my free time I enjoy reading apologetics books and watching theological debates to better understand and defend my faith.

### Work Experience
I acquired some counseling experience this past summer working as a camp counselor at Triple R Ranch. Granted camp counseling does not fully equate to professional counseling, however they both require an abundance of patience.

Prior to working at Triple R, I was employed by Chick-Fil-A for five years. While there, I worked my way up to becoming the nighttime kitchen manager. Through my position I quickly learned how to work under intense pressure and how to lead some tense and difficult conversations. Not to mention I got a ton fond memories and stories from being there, like one time we were sued for buying sandwich buns at Food Lion (we lost that one).

I've also worked as a landscaper with my brother before working at Chick-Fil-A. Between mowing lawns and pressure washing driveways, we did just about anything under the sun. Through this job we learned both the value of a dollar, but also the importance of putting on sunscreen.

### Interests
I enjoy cooking in my free time and experiencing new things. I currently live alone in a one-bedroom apartment so whenever I cook, I typically invite a friend over so I’m not stuck with all the leftovers.

Game nights are a regular occurrence at my place, and I love battling against my friends in strategy games. I particularly like playing One Night Werewolf and Exploding Kittens. 

Archery is another interest I get a kick out of on the weekends. I have yet to actually become very skilled at it, but I have come a long way from not even being able to hit the target.
