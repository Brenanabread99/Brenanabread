My Name is Brennen Savi...! 
![Brennen Savi](https://brenanabread99.github.io/Brenanabread/images/Profile Image.jpg)
 and I am working towards attaining my BA in Psychology at Christopher Newport University. After I graduate, I will then seek a master’s in counseling at Liberty University from which I will pursue my passion of helping others through becoming a Licensed Professional Counselor. I currently have a mentor who is guiding my way through school and the field itself.

I’ve even done some counseling work this past summer as a camp counselor at Triple R Ranch. Granted camp counseling does not fully equate to professional counseling, however they both require an abundance of patience. The camp itself is a Christian camp and through it I was able to share the gospel with hundreds of kids.

Prior to working at Triple R, I was employed by Chick-Fil-A for five years. While there, I worked my way up to becoming the nighttime kitchen manager. Through my position I learned how to work under intense pressure and how to lead some tense and difficult conversations. That job provided an unique opportunity to always have off on Sundays which is important to me.

My faith is something I center and build my life around. I am very involved with two churches in my area, and I’ve been a 1st grade leader at one for the last three and a half years. At college I've recently begun attending a fellowship group and joined a weekly bible study. In my free time I enjoy reading apologetics books and watching theological debates to better understand and defend my faith.

I also worked as a landscaper with my brother before working at Chick-Fil-A. Between mowing lawns and pressure washing driveways my brother and I did just about anything under the sun. Through this job we learned both the value of a dollar, but also the importance of putting on sunscreen.

I enjoy cooking in my free time and experiencing new things. I currently live alone in a one-bedroom apartment so whenever I cook, I typically invite a friend so I’m not stuck with all the leftovers.

Game nights are a regular occurence at my place and I enjoy battling against my friends in different games. I very much enjoy playing One Night Werewolf and jackbox games on the switch. 

Archery is another interest of mine I enjoy doing on the weekends. I have yet to actually become very skilled at it, but I have come a long way from not even being able to hit the target.
