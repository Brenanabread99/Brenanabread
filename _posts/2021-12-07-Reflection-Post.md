## Defining Digital Humanities

Over the course of this semester, I have learned numerous things in this Digital Humanities class. For starters, I gained a basic understanding of what Digital Humanities even means. If I had been asked prior to this semester to provide a definition of what DH is, I would have said it simply sounds like the digitalization of art. 

However, I have since come to learn that DH is so much more than that. Simply put, Digital Humanities is taking large amounts of data and creatively displaying it in an interesting, interactive, and engaging way. These humanities projects typically use digital interactive maps and visually stimulating presentations of data. They are often for educational purposes and are almost always open access to bring awareness to different topics.
     
## Creating My Own Project

I was fortunate to create a Digital Humanities project using Thinglink (displayed below). I was encouraged to creatively design my project since the assignment involved developing a map of my personal experiences from CNU. I myself am a commuter student, so my engagement with different campus activities is very limited. I ultimately created an interactive map detailing my typical day at school. In creating the Digital Humanities project, it made me realize that there are so many little things I do on a daily basis which I take for granted. Through the use of digital humanities, I found ways to not only appreciate those little things, but also find creative ways to express my life to others.

## Skills Acquired 
 
Upon reflecting on the activities of this course, I realize that I now have a deeper understanding of the numerous ways to digitally provide information to the public. The mapping program for my CNU project was shockingly easy to use and engage with. Through learning how simple it can be to design a DH project, I am no longer intimidated at the thought of personally completing such a task. 
     
I also learned how to use GitHub which was far more challenging than I was expecting. The writing of different code was initially confusing, and the inability to easily adjust picture sizes was unbelievably frustrating. But after consulting Dr. Stover, reviewing tutorials, and extensively researching problems, I now have a working understanding of the platform. However, although I understand the program, I do not plan to ever use it again. In my opinion, it is not at all user friendly, and I would prefer to simply use WordPress if I decide to write a blog.
     
Twitter is another program I was privileged to engage with weekly. I learned how to use social media, and how simple it is to tweet. My favorite feature on Twitter is the little progress circle you receive while you’re typing. Twitter allows a maximum of 140 characters per tweet and the progress circle tells you the number of characters you have left. 
     
## Readings and Twitter Posts

The choice to use twitter as the platform for our discussion posts made it astronomically easier and actually fairly fun at times. It was such a relief to have a character limit and a need to be concise. Often with discussion boards they are just annoying busy work assigned in classes. In contrast, through the use of twitter, these discussion board posts led to students becoming more connected and led to students enjoying responding to each other.

The readings were almost always fun to read through. The reading about eye scanning patterns I found the most helpful and relatable. It really taught me the best ways to grab a reader's attention. It also made me consider the different ways people scan documents and how it varies depending upon their motivation for reading. The most interesting reading involved learning about CNU. I found it fascinating the racial basis for the founding of the school. While I often learn of the racial injustices of the past, it’s easy to disassociate from it and subconsciously think those things did not happen where I live. This reading pulled off the veil from that idea and struck really close to home.

The only complaint I suppose I have regarding the readings is it was very easy to simply not do all of them. I often would forget and then remember I was supposed to do them once class began. I would always do at least one or two a week for discussion board purposes, but aside from that I wish at times that I could have done more. 

## Conclusion

I believe this class has provided me with a greater understanding of Digital Humanities and how difficult it is to define. It has also made me more prepared and capable to digitally share and creatively present data to a large audience.
