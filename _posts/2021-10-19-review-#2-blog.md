Land-Grab Universities creates a detailed acount of how the United States funded land-grant universities with land taken from Indigenous people groups. The project seeks to display how land granted to the universities was unfairly taken from indigenos people and used to fund universites that may be thousands of miles away.. It reveals how in every case the land turned an exponetial profit for university funding while the those forced off the land received little to no compensation.

### *Design*

The project equips the proper coding to allow ease of use on laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. The project itself organizes the vast amont of information it provides into several different tabs. The tabs consist of the following: *Overview, Universities, Nations, Lands, and Stories*. This design helps readers find the information they are seeking without having to search through the whole site.

### *Findings*

Land-grab Universities **overview tab** is the first tab displayed when users first enter the site. The site's purpose is then easily explained through the use of a map which instructs users to scroll through it. As this is done, the map changes as users scroll through diffent series of text.

The **Maps tab** contains information regarding both the maps’ purpose and how to interact with the map itself. An addition which is incredibly helpful considering the complexity of the map and its many features. The map itself is very visually appealing and puts into perspective the landscape of wartime Washington.

The map does however contains a couple flaws. The interactive map key overlaps itself rendering it partially useless. Additionally, numerous points on the map do not have links to information even when it is available. For example, the bawdy houses contain the names of the homeowners. However, it does not provide links to the additional information available in the data tab. Lastly, two of the maps provided are not large enough to display all the points provided. The outmost points are then displayed in a white void thus defeating the purpose of the map.

The **Data** and **Texts tabs** both contain search bars allowing users to easily locate specific information. The data tab in particular contains a flaw where four out of five links do not actually lead to the data downloads they offer. Aside from this though, both tabs have an added feature allowing users to freely browse various categories (people, places, newspapers, medical cases, etc.).

The **Visual Works tab** provides authentic pictures taken in Washington during the Civil War. The pictures contain minimal information regrding the context of the photos. Yet even without the context, the photos allow readers to immerse themselves in Washington during this chaotic period.

The **Interpretations tab** contains several essays written by the authors of Civil War Washington. These essays educate readers on the values and biases that may have influenced the project. Furthermore, many of the essays dive deep into the issues unfolding in Washington. The essays cover topics such as medical cases, emancipations, hospitals, and segregation just to name a few. The analysis itself comes from every conceivable perspective thus providing a clear picture of each topic.

The project overall is a remarkable resource that shines a light on the environment in Washington during the Civil War. It allows for in depth research into individuals, as well as providing a comprehensive overview of large subject matters.
