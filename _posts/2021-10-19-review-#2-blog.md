Land-Grab Universities creates a detailed account of how the United States funded land-grant universities with land taken from Indigenous people groups. The project seeks to display how land granted to the universities was unfairly taken from indigenous people and used to fund universities that may be thousands of miles away. It reveals how in every case the land turned an exponential profit for university funding while the those forced off the land received little to no compensation.

### *Design*

The project equips the proper coding to allow ease of use on laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. The project itself organizes the vast amount of information it provides into several different tabs. The tabs consist of the following: *Overview, Universities, Nations, Lands, and Stories*. This design helps readers find the information they are seeking without having to search through the whole site.

### *Findings*

Land-grab Universities **overview tab** is the first tab displayed when users first enter the site. The site's purpose is then easily explained through the use of a map which instructs users to scroll through it. As this is done, the map changes as users scroll through different series of text. The progression of a few map changes is shown below.

Once users scroll past this first feature on the **overview tab**, A brief introduction is provided. It provides a wealth of information that may overwhelm the average reader. It also condenses the topic into three brief and concise paragraphs. While this may seem helpful, the information provided is not simplified and if misunderstood, the rest of the site will not be understandable.

On a more positive note, a toolbar appears at the top of the screen once the initial introduction section is scrolled past. The toolbar enables users to jump to different tabs.

As users scroll past the introduction, they come across an interactive map. The map itself displays the land-grants provided to 52 different universities. These thousands of parcels of land all across the country could then be sold to fund the building of the universities. The lines branching across the map demonstrate the distance between the universities and the parcels of land they were granted to sell. The map is very visually appealing. However, as mentioned earlier, if the brief introduction is misunderstood, users will be confused, and the map is not going to be remotely understandable. There are brief instructions explaining the colorful arching lines are meant to display how land was distributed to universities. However, this can be confusing if users do not grasp that the universities then sold the land for a profit.

Even in light of this, the map has several helpful ways it can be interacted with. It allows users see all the land-grants provided in the United States and also allows individual states to be singled out. The map is able to be toggled between both a plain black map and a satellite map. Users are also able to add/remove state boundaries, Indigenous Cessions, and Land-University Links. The map allows a user's location to be accessed so readers can view land-grants in their own area. Lastly, the perspective of the map can be easily adjusted to provide better perspectives.

However, with the numerous benefits of this map, there are also a few flaws. The map does allow for it to be put into full screen. Adding this feature would greatly improve a user's experience. The ways to modify the map are displayed on the map itself thus impairing the view. Allowing these map modifications to be hidden would greatly improve the maps functionality.
