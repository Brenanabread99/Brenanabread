Land-Grab Universities creates a detailed account of how the United States funded land-grant universities. The project displays how land was granted to the universities which was unfairly taken from indigenous people. The land was then both used and sold to found universities. The data details the insignificant amount of compensation those forced off their land received while also showing the massive profits universities received from the sale of the land.
 
### *Design*
 
The project equips the proper coding to allow ease of use on laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. The project itself organizes the vast amount of information it provides into several different tabs. The tabs consist of the following: *Overview, Universities, Nations, Lands, and Stories*. This design helps readers find the information they are seeking without having to search through the whole site.

### *Findings*
 
Land-grab Universities **overview tab** is the first tab displayed when users first enter the site. The site's purpose is then easily explained through the use of a map which instructs users to scroll through it. As this is done, the map changes as users scroll through different series of text. The progression of a few map changes is shown below.

Once users scroll past this first feature on the **overview tab**, A brief introduction is provided. It provides a wealth of information, but the lengthy topic is condensed into three concise paragraphs.  While this may seem helpful, the information provided is not simplified and if misunderstood, the rest of the site will not be understandable.
 
On a more positive note, a toolbar appears at the top of the screen once the initial introduction section is scrolled past. The toolbar enables users to jump to different tabs.

As users scroll past the introduction, they come across an interactive map. The map itself displays the land-grants provided to 52 different universities. These thousands of parcels of land all across the country were sold to fund higher education universities. The lines branching across the map demonstrate the distance between the universities and the parcels of land they were granted to sell. In many cases the land is thousands of miles away. The map is very visually appealing. However, as mentioned earlier, if the brief introduction is misunderstood, users will be easily confused as to what the map is displaying. There are brief instructions explaining the colorful arching lines, but this can be confusing if users do not grasp how universities are connected to land so far away.

Even in light of this, the map has several helpful ways it can be interacted with. The map allows users to see an overview of the land-grants provided in the United States and also those granted to individual states. The map can be toggled between a plain black map and a satellite map and users can add/remove state boundaries, Indigenous Cessions, and Land-University Links. Furthermore, a user's location can be accessed so readers can view land-grants in their own area.

Although the designers of the map clearly put a great deal of effort into the map, there are still a few flaws. The map cannot be placed into full screen and this feature could greatly improve a user's experience. Additionally, map modifications are displayed on the map itself thus impairing the view. Allowing these modifications to be hidden would greatly improve the map's functionality. 
 
In addition to the **overview tab**, there are also the **Universities, Nations, Lands, and Stories tabs**. The **Universities, Nations, and Lands tabs** displays the costs for parcels of land and how much universities profited from them. These three tabs display massive amounts of data through the perspectives of each parcel of land, how much universities profited, and the severity of which tribal nations were under compensated.

Under the **Stories tab**, background is provided upon how the different tribal nations were treated and how they were forced off their land. These four tabs allow readers to receive the full and complete perspective of the effects of Land-Grant Universities.
